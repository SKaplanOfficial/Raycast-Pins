Pins Version: 1.3.0

Pins supports various placeholders that are evaluated at runtime whenever you open/execute a pin. These placeholders are useful for pinning items that rely on the current context, such as the current selection. The placeholders system is provided as a way to supply additional functionality for users that need or want it without complicating the core functionality of Pins.

The following placeholders are currently supported:

{{clipboardText}} -- The current text content of the clipboard.

{{currentAppName}} -- The name of the frontmost application.

{{currentAppPath}} -- The POSIX path to the bundle of the frontmost application.

{{currentDirectory}} -- The POSIX path of Finder's current insertion location. This is the desktop if no Finder windows are open.

{{selectedText}} -- The currently selected text.
